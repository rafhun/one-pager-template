Very early template for using the fullpage.js library to create onepage style sites with ease. Is based on HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap but can be adapted to any use one might imagine.

This was one of the very first templates I set up, keep that in mind when you find not so smart decisions or naming ;)
